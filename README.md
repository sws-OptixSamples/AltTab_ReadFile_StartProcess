# AltTab_ReadFile_StartProcess

Sample project to demonstrate how Optix can simulate Windows keyboard strokes to perform a common function like "Alt-Tag" to switch between open applications within a Windows OS.

The project also reads a text file from Windows\Temp via NetLogic and puts each line into the Info.Log to demonstrate how you could read lines for other functions/methods in NetLogic.

Finally, there is a simple method that opens the Windows calculator by calling Process.Start.
